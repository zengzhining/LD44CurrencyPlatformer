### About This game
the theme is Your life is currency.

It make me think of the book I read before, call Chronicle of a Blood Merchant. it is a story about a man selling blood to earn money to overcome some difficulty.

And I think it is good for the theme and would like to make it. 

Although it is a very simple platformer game. 

Hope anyone would like it.



### Tools I use
This time I try to use Construct2 Game Engine. For the art I use Aseprite. And Sound use BFXR.
